# angular-i18n-messagesXLF-cleaner
This project is supposed to help developers who want to clean up they i18n messages files from the unnecessary context-group and context tags.

You can also generate a test file what will duplicate all your source content into a <target> tag below your source and extend it with "_test"
With this test file you can test which content of your app is translated by loading it to your app.
After you have loaded it to your app you will see on your UI the translated texts.
